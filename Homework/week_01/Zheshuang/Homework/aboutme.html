    	<p>Hello!My name is Zheshuang Cai. I'm from China. Currently I am doing a double degree program in the University of Southern California. Before coming here, I have been studying in London for a year and I love Europea so much! I am really fond of arts and operas, and of course traveling. I also cook good(according to my friends lol) Chinese food. What's more, I'm a digital fanatic and intrerested in all kinds of stuff. I've been working as a product manager in <a href="http://www.bingyan.net/">Bingyan Studio</a> in my university and did internship in Interent companies. It is amazing to see how Internet has changed the way we live, especially in recent years. And since I love the startup culture, I want to get a job in the high tech industry, maybe doing product management. Though I don't know exactly how can I get to the right direction, I think this course can help me polish my web design skills and probably get some knowledge of UX design in the meanwhile. Finally, it's really nice to meet and learn with you all!
