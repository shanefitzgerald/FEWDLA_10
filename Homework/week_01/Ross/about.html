			<!-- the way they did this in the example is not really good form.  What you have done is the better way of doing this.  They remove the <a></a> tag from the "about me" when your on the about.html and remove the <a></a> of "resume" when your on the index.html.  I have changed to code to make it work like the example but you should do it the way you originally did it where you include two <a></a> tags.  If this doesn't make sense lets talk on Sat. -->

	<h2>Resume</h2>
				
		<p>I recently graduated from a Web Development course at General Assembly where I increased my typing speed from 10 words per minute on my type writer to 100 words per minute on my new MacBook Pro. They also taught me how to be an <strong>awesome</strong> Web Developer. During my spare time, I enjoy senior water aerobics, pickling, and spending time with my great grand children.</p>
